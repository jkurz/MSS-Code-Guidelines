## Contributors
**YOU!** - please contribute to these code guidelines! If you have any
suggestions for improvement to these guidelines, *[create an issue][issue]* to
discuss it or *create a [pull request][pr]* with your changes and discussion
will occur on that PR.  Also review the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/TurnerBroadcasting/mss-code-guidelines/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Conflict Resolution
We have included [JSHint][jshint] and [JSCS][jscs] RC files in this repository
to validate javascript code against these guidelines.  When something is
questioned, these files will always win.  When in doubt, run JSHint and JSCS
with the `.jshintrc` and `.jscsrc` files in place and see if they find any
problems.  It is recommended that you find plugins for your editor of choice to
always validate your code against these files.

### Regarding the multiple suffixed files
There are several `.jscs` and `.jshintrc` files with suffixes in this repo.  It
is up to you to choose the most appropriate one for your project.  Hopefully the
suffixes are clear, but just in case, here are some more details.

- **.jscs**: A JavaScript Code Style config file for ECMAScript 5 code.

- **.jscs-es6**: A JavaScript Code Style config file for ECMAScript 6 code.

- **.jshintrc-browser**: A JS Hint config file for browser based ECMAScript 5
  code.

- **.jshintrc-node**: A JS Hint config file for NodeJS 0.10.x ECMAScript 5 code.

- **.jshintrc-node-es6**: A JS Hint config file for NodeJS 0.11.x+ and IO.js
  ECMAScript 6 code.


## JavaScript
The JavaScript guidelines are based off of [idiomatic.js][idiomatic].

For lots of code examples that show the style we want, see the
[airbnb guide][airbnb].

The MSS Guidelines will be the same with the following additional rules applied.


### Test Facility
We will be using:

- Mocha / Chai for unit tests
- Selenium (WebdriverJS) / Mocha / Chai for functional tests
- PhantomJS / CasperJS for functional tests


### Idiomatic Style Manifesto
0. Whitespace
    - 4-space soft indents are required.  This means four spaces or four spaces
      representing a tab.

0. Beautiful Syntax
    - 2.A - 2.C should not have `inner-space`.  Refer to 2.D for a syntax
      without `inner-space`.  Here is an example.
      ```javascript
      function foo(bar, baz) {
          var qux = bar + baz;

          for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
              console.log(qux);
          }

          if (bar === baz) {
              qux = bar * baz;
          } else {
              qux = bar / baz;
          }

          return qux;
      }
      ```

    - Single quotes must be used.

    - Object literals should look like this.
      ```javascript
      var objectLiteral;

      objectLiteral = {
          foo: 'bar',
          baz: 'qux'
      };
      ```

    - Milliseconds should be assigned in multiples of 1000, and always use
      explicit order of operations.
      ```javascript
      var
          oneSecond = 1000 * 1,
          oneMinute = 1000 * 60,
          fiveMinutes = (1000 * 60) * 5;
      ```


## HTML
0. Write clean semantic HTML5 markup.
0. Use double quotes for attributes.
0. Use proper indention.
0. Selector Attributes
  Never use an ID as a styling hook.
  Prefix any JavaScript class hooks with `js-`. Example: `class="js-foo foo"`
0. Closing `<li>` elements.
  `<li>` elements should not be closed. [Further reading on this inline-block
  issue.][inline]


## CSS / Sass
0. The CSS / Sass guidelines are based off of [csswizardry/CSS-Guidelines][css].
0. We use [nomalize.css][normalize] as our style reset.


#### Our CSS / Sass overrides
0. Declarations.
  Declarations should be in aplhabetical order (**NOT** by relevance).


## Markdown
0. All lines that are not code blocks should wrap at or under 80 columns.
0. Should allow trailing whitespace, since that is a valid Markdown syntax.
0. Should have 2 blank lines above each H1 and H2 heading except for the
   heading at the top of the document.  This is optinal for other headings.
0. Should have 4 blank lines to separate the link reference at the bottom of
   the document.
0. Should use `0.` for ordered lists
0. Should use `-` for unordered lists
0. Secondary bullets must be indented four spaces to render correctly on
  Bitbucket.
0. Do not try to put code blocks as secondary bullets in a list.  They will not
  render correctly on both GitHub and BitBucket. More details on this to come
  in the future.
